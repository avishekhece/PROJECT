# WOMAN SECURITY DEVICE
The papers purpose is based on a security device used to call aid in times of emergency. The primary audience for this device is women. The device will work as a defense system to protect the wearer from assault attempts. The Pivotal component for this device is an Arduino microprocessor. A GPS module, GSM module, and a voice recording module will be connected to the Arduino. The GPS and GSM module will send the userâ€™s location and connect the call to an SOS number, and to the nearest police station. The device will also be equipped with self- defence mechanisms, like a stun gun. Miscellaneous components will be further added as the project progresses. The primary task of this project was to find the components for the prototype. The following steps are assembling the individual components, and coding the microprocessor/microcontroller. Components were found in a short time. Assembling the individual components is taking longer than expected since this is the first time a project like this is being undertaken. Components with which we do not have prior experience are not only being used but also we need to assemble them in a way that works with the other components as well. The coding part has not yet commenced, since the preceding step needed to be done before.
